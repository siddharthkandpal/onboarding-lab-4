* What’s the difference between an interface library and a “normal” library or executable? Can you think of any uses for this besides System Verilog files? (Think about source code used for generic programming)

An interface library typically provides a set of programming interfaces or APIs that allow software components to interact with each other in a defined way wheras a normal library or executable contains code that performs specific functions or operations that can be called by other software components. Besides System Verilog,  interfaces can be used to define a contract between different software components, specifying the methods and data that can be accessed by other components.


* What is a top module?

The module which contains every other module and is not instantiated with any other module.
